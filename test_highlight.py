Tried their large Classic (sausage, mushroom, peppers and onions) deep dish;\

Pizza = I've had better.  The crust/dough was just way too effin' dry for me.\
Yes, I know what 'cornmeal' is, thanks.  But it's way too dry.\
I'm not talking about the bottom of the pizza...I'm talking about the dough \
that's in between the sauce and bottom of the pie...it was like cardboard, sorry!
Wings = spicy and good.   Bleu cheese dressing only...hmmm, but no alternative\
of ranch dressing, at all.  Service = friendly enough at the counters.  
Decor = freakin' dark.  I'm not sure how people can see their food.  
Parking = a real pain.  Good luck.
